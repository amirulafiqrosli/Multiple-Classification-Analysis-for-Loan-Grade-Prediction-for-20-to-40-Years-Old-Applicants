# Multiple Classification Analysis for Loan Grade Prediction for 20 to 40 Years Old Applicants

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for loan grade multiple classification using a dataset comprising 32,581 records and 12 features related to loan applicants. The target variable, loan grade, represents the risk associated with each loan application. The project involves comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure the quality of input data. Subsequently, six classification models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, k-NN, Naive Bayes and SVM, will be trained and evaluated on the dataset. The aim is to identify the most effective model in predicting loan grades based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also encompasses hyperparameter tuning, model interpretability, handling of imbalanced classes, and considerations for ethical implications. Ultimately, the developed model seeks to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals by providing a robust and accurate classification of loan grades.
